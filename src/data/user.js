			"Welcome to my website! I'm a native New Englander who now calls New York City home. As a former teacher turned software engineer, I thrive on the daily challenges and continuous learning that both professions offer. Beyond my professional endeavors, I find joy in attending shows with my wife and friends, building computers for gaming, and playing sports. Whether it's the excitement of that legendary live performance, the satisfaction of optimizing software and hardware, or the thrill of friendly competition, I embrace diverse passions. If you ever feel like checking out a show, playing some Diablo IV, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out!",
